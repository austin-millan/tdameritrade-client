# TD Ameritrade OpenAPI Specification (Unofficial)

## About

TD Ameritrade uses the OpenAPI (OAI) Specification to describe its REST APIs. 
This unofficial specification is based on [https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis](https://developer.tdameritrade.com/apis),
but in contrast to the offficial specification, this one will provide you with a single OAI v3 file that can be used
directly for code generation and other benefits of OAI.

## Support

Please post any issues or amendments to the specification via GitHub.
